        <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
        <p>1. Background <br><br>
          Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a farming system driven by the community, for the community, focusing on production and consumption. In CSA, a committed group of individuals supports community farming activities by producing and facilitating the consumption of high-quality food products. Under this system, a group of producers directly sells and distributes quality food products to consumers. In some models, consumers make advance payments for expected production costs, making it easier for producers to purchase necessary inputs. Additionally, both consumers and producers share the risks of production, fostering a stronger mutual relationship.

          CSA requires one or more groups of producers and consumers. CSA producers agree to supply products (vegetables, fruits, meat, milk, etc.) to consumers who purchase shares. Besides providing marketing convenience, CSA also serves as an important community-building component.

          i. Rationale of Organic CSA<br><br>
          There are two major challenges in organic farming promotionâ€”production-related issues and market-related issues. CSA opens pathways to address production challenges while eliminating middlemen, ensuring that profits directly reach producers and consumers, thereby solving market-related issues. Since CSA has the potential to resolve both challenges, this model is being proposed for promoting organic farming in Chitlang.
